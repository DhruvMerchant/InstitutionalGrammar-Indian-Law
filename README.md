2. Final_code is a modular code implementing the heurisitics and finding accuracies as well.
3. Code book is an important reference material for the given project since we are following the regulatory statements mentioned in it.
4. metrics sheet is the sheet with results from our model compared to the gold standard for calculating accuracies
5. Reference sheet contains observations about the steps performed in each heuristic in detail in the "Observations sheet". 
6. Reference sheet also contains the gold standard.
